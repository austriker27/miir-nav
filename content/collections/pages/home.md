# MiiR is doing amazing things.

### I'm [David Lindahl](https://davidalindahl.com), Front End Developer and I want to help.

I love crafting beautiful digital experiences and have done so for 5+ years for internal products and external clients.

Web projects I've worked on in the last year or so include:

- [A new from scratch website for the rebrand of Product Hunt's #1 upvoted product of 2021](https://Sprig.com)
- [A brand new website for the biggest PHP news site](https://Laravel-News.com)
- [The COVID Awareness website for the Ad Council which was featured in Nationally Televised Ad Campaigns](https://getvaccineanswers.org/)

Also I eat, sleep, and drink Shopify (and in my sparetime run my own Shopify storefront that donates from every purchase - inspired by MiiR).
