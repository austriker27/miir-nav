# Miir Nav

I spent several hours redesigning and then rebuilding the MiiR navigation. I followed some modern CRO and ecommerce practices and simplified the menu overall to make things easier on the end user.

Also I used Statamic, AlpineJS, and Tailwind CSS to achieve a super fast time from start to deployment and deployed the static build to Netlify.

## Ideas
- Consolidate login and create account on one login screen that has a link for create account
- Consolidate several other menu dropdowns to simplify things
- Move 'not critical' links to the footer

### Focus on Products:
- Highlight product collections in Shop Menu
- Add images for collections for more visual representation
- Add menu item for "Top Sellers"
